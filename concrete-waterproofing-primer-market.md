<p><strong>Market Segmentation</strong></p>
<p><strong>The Concrete Waterproofing Primer Market Analysis by types is segmented into:</strong></p>
<p><ul><li>One-component</li><li>Two-component</li></ul></p>
<p><p>The concrete waterproofing primer market is divided into two primary types: one-component and two-component systems. One-component primers are ready-to-use, requiring no mixing, which simplifies application and reduces labor costs. They offer effective moisture resistance but may have limitations in performance compared to two-component systems. Conversely, two-component primers involve mixing a resin with a hardener, resulting in superior adhesion and durability. While they may require more setup and curing time, their enhanced properties make them ideal for demanding applications.</p></p>
