<p><strong>Market Segmentation</strong></p>
<p><strong>The TIRF Microscopes Market Analysis by types is segmented into:</strong></p>
<p><ul><li>Prism Method</li><li>Objective Lens Method</li></ul></p>
<p><p>Total Internal Reflection Fluorescence (TIRF) microscopes utilize two main methods: the prism method and the objective lens method. The prism method involves placing a prism at the bottom of the sample slide to achieve total internal reflection, creating an evanescent wave that selectively excites fluorophores near the surface. Conversely, the objective lens method uses a high-NA objective lens to achieve TIRF by directing laser light through the lens, offering more flexibility and improved imaging capabilities in cellular studies.</p></p>
