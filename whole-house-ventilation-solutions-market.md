<p><strong>Market Segmentation</strong></p>
<p><strong>The Whole-House Ventilation Solutions Market Analysis by types is segmented into:</strong></p>
<p><ul><li>Exhaust Ventilation Systems</li><li>Supply Ventilation Systems</li><li>Balanced Ventilation Systems</li><li>Energy Recovery Systems</li></ul></p>
<p><p>Whole-house ventilation solutions are essential for maintaining indoor air quality and energy efficiency. Exhaust ventilation systems remove stale air, creating a slight negative pressure that draws in fresh air. Supply ventilation systems, on the other hand, introduce fresh air while exhausting stale air, maintaining positive pressure. Balanced ventilation systems simultaneously supply and exhaust air, ensuring equal airflow. Energy recovery systems optimize energy use by transferring heat and moisture between incoming and outgoing air, enhancing comfort and efficiency in residential buildings.</p></p>
